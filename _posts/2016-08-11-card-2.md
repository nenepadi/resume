<a href="http://ahonya.com/" target="_blank">Ahonya.com</a> is Ghana's leading e-commerce stop point. I worked on front-end design and coding. My most recent project was to develop a theme for <a href="http://myahonya.com/" target="_blank">Ahonya Webstore</a>, a cluster of shops for authentic sellers within Accra and its environs.
